Currently, the process of reading water meters involves manual readings by personnel, followed by the distribution of bills to customers. This method is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors and delays. Moreover, the subsequent distribution of bills adds another layer of complexity and time consumption.

        Our solution to these challenges are sorted out by developing an innovative technology that automates meter reading and billing procedures.

Working: step1:Installation of smart water reading meters equipped with remote monitoring capabilities. These are installed at point where water enters a property. It measures the volume of water consumed by each household.

step2: These meters will automatically transmit consumption data at predefined intervals to our centralized database. This database serves as a repository for all consumption data, allowing for streamlined analysis, billing calculations and of usage patterns.

step3: Upon receiving the data, our system will employ advanced algorithms to accurately calculate the water usage for each customer during the billing rate. This automated process eliminates the need for manual intervention, thereby reducing human error and ensuring timely billing.

step4: We provide a user friendly online platform where customers can securely access their billing information.so they can view detailed breakdowns of their water consumption, track usage trends over time and conveniently pay their bills online.
